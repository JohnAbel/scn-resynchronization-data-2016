This directory contains all experimental data used in ``Funtional network inference of the suprachiasmatic nucleus'' by J.H. Abel et al.

- One folder contains trajectories and location coordinates for cells which could be continuously tracked throughout all conditions (full_time_trajectories)
- One folder contains trajectories, location coordinates, and mic scores for all cells which could be tracked during the TTX washout time period (ttx_wash_trajectories)

For the full trajectories of SCNs 1-5:
    ttx_time = [90,109,82,107,113]
    wash_time = [234,252,224,240,242]

For additional questions or the code used in processing this data, please contact the authors.
