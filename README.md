This directory contains all experimental data used in ``Funtional network inference of the suprachiasmatic nucleus'' by J.H. Abel et al.



- One folder contains trajectories and location coordinates for cells which could be continuously tracked throughout all conditions (full_time_trajectories)
- One folder contains trajectories, location coordinates, and mic scores for all cells which could be tracked during the TTX washout time period (ttx_wash_trajectories)

Within these files, each cell is in a column, with each 1h sample as an entry within that column. Locations match cells. MIC scores are presented as an adjacency matrix.

For the full trajectories of SCNs 1-5:
    ttx_time = [90,109,82,107,113]
    wash_time = [234,252,224,240,242]

We have added the raw pairwise MIC scores for each SCN. To get the network associated with each SCN, apply thresholds = [0.949,0.935,0.9895,0.968,0.969].
